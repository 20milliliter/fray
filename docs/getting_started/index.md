# Getting Started

Somewhere down the line I hope to make in engine editors which will make working with Fray more intuative. However, for now everything must be done programmatically which i've attempted to make as user-friendly as I can.

## Modules

- [State](./mod_state/index.md)

- [Input](./mod_input/index.md)

- [Collision](./mod_collision/index.md)
