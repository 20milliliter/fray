# Getting Started

Fray is a godot combat framework for developing fighting / action style games. If your game requires changes in combatant state corresponding to specific button presses, detecting combination button presses or sequence presses, or hitboxes and hit state manamagent then you may benefit from the tools Fray provides. The framework is divided into 3 modules that can be used independent of one another meaning you to run your own solutions alongside Fray.

Below you can find breif tutorials on getting started with each module.
