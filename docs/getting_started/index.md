# Getting Started

Somewhere down the line I hope to make in engine editors which will make working with Fray more intuative. However, for now everything must be done programmatically which i've attempted to make as user-friendly as I can.

[Demo](https://github.com/Pyxus/fray/releases/download/v1.0.0/fray_demo.zip) showcasing input processing and state mangaement.

## Modules

- [State](./mod_state/index.md)
