Stray Combat Framework (SCF) is a work in progress addon for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org). It features tools for implementing action / fighting game style combat such as hit detection, input buffering, and fighter state management.

## âœ¨ Core Features

### Complex Input Support

SCF provides support for the 'complex' inputs featured in many fighting games such as [directional inputs](https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Command_input#Directional_inputs), [motion inputs](https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Command_input#Motion_input), [charged inputs](https://clips.twitch.tv/FuriousObservantOrcaGrammarKing-c1wo4zhroMVZ9I7y), and [sequence inputs](https://mugen.fandom.com/wiki/Command_input#Sequence_inputs).

This support is provided through...

- **Combination Inputs** : Distinct virtual inputs resulting from the press of 2 or more buttons. For example pressing down + right in most 2D fighting games are detected as a distinct diagonal button press even though no such diagonal button exists.

- **Conditional Inputs** : Inputs that change due to some condition. For instance in most 2D fighting games the direction of a quarter circle input changes based on which side of you stand relative to your opponent.

- **Input Sequence Detection** : Scans input stream and detects predefined sequences.
